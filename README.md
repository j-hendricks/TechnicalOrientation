## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! This is where I will be documenting some of the cool things I learned while completing the MSDS Technical Orientation at UVA.

To learn more about this technical orientation, please see the program's repo [here](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/tree/main).

## What I Have Learned So Far

GitHub serves as both a software development platform as well as a form of social media. Describing it as just one or the other tells an incomplete story. Here are examples of both of these functions:

* Software Development
  - Promotes development of "Libre Software"<sup>1</sup> via open source collaboration and peer review
  - Emphasizes ownership through the logging of who made changes and what those changes were
  - Makes Git easy to use through a UI
  - Enables development team to work remotely and offline
* Social Media
  - Faculty and career advisors across academia urge students to establish an online presense on GitHub to impress employers and connect with professionals<sup>2-4</sup>
  - Each user has their own public profile with the option of adding links to other social media sites
  - Voluntary debuggers are largely motivated by community recognition<sup>5</sup>
